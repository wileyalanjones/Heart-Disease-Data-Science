# 🫀 Heart Disease Data Science Analysis

This project is a comprehensive data science analysis of heart disease datasets. The goal was to explore and model the underlying patterns associated with heart disease using both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and others for data preprocessing and visualization.

## 📊 Project Overview

This analysis includes:

### 🔍 Unsupervised Learning
We applied clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques to explore inherent structures in the data without using labels:

- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering**

These methods helped uncover natural groupings in the data and reduce its complexity for better visualization and further analysis.

### 🎯 Supervised Learning
Several classification and regression models were implemented to predict heart disease presence and evaluate model performance:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Random Forest**
- **AdaBoost**
- **Stacking Classifier**

Each model was evaluated using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) to determine its effectiveness.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis consists of health-related metrics and target labels indicating the presence of heart disease. The data was cleaned and preprocessed prior to modeling.

## 📈 Results & Insights

Through exploratory data analysis and machine learning modeling, the project aimed to:

- Identify key features influencing heart disease
- Cluster patients with similar risk profiles
- Compare the performance of various classifiers
- Explore ensemble methods to improve predictive performance
